## About Me

I'm passionate about building scalable, secure, and cost-effective cloud solutions using AWS.  
Linux is where I’m most at home — whether it's writing scripts, managing systems, or diving deep into the command line.

I enjoy simplifying complex technical challenges and making infrastructure easier to manage and understand.
